@188779 was a good Will Ferrell movie from last year .
@137861 was a low _UNK_ , but good movie , too .

Good . Would you like to watch some old horror movies like @128044 , or @119424

It 's a dark British comedy about a new police officer in a small town . It has a very big twist .
It 's extremely clever .
He 's trying to find out who the serial killer is . Yeah . It 's awesome ! It 's a good way to kill a few hours .
Nice . Have a good one .

I _UNK_ ; d n't reccomend @119840 to watch with your lady ... it is pretty _UNK_ and rough Unless she is tough ! lol
very good one is @181960 directed by this _UNK_ Lars _UNK_ _UNK_ ... it is spooky and gross but very well directed . The photography is beautiful and eerie

Hi ! What kind of movies do you like best ?
There are quite a few of those out now . Have you seen any of those yet ?
Have you seen @205163 ?
OK , take care !
I 'm doing well . What kinds of movies are you looking for ?
I have n't seen @206020 yet , but one of my friends was telling me she enjoyed it .
If you like documentaries , yes .
Do you like thrillers ? @205430 is creepy !
@95692 looks good too , but I only saw the previews .
OK , take care !
What sort of movies do you like , good sir or _UNK_ ?
Ah ! Let me think .... there is always the classic @168568 if you like older flicks .
And there is the _UNK_ time travel movie @147314 lol
you want a VERY serious time travel movie ful of science and brain twists , you could try @129966 It is almost TOO serious but it is really good
I think one of my favorites is good old @135485
There are a lot of good time travel movies out there _UNK_ ! Me too ! ! ! Good _UNK_ to you ! Hope you have some good suggestions
I 'm not super familiar with scary movies . I have a friend who loves them and prefers the classics like @77161 and @86831
I havent seen Taken but I did enjoy @101264 which is a thriller in sort of a different vein
Thrillers like @101264 I would also suggest @132885 as well .
Or @197213 as well !
Have a good day !
Hi there , what kind of movies are you looking to see ?
Yes , have you seen @127588 ? That one was a real eye opener to the food and farming industry
I loved Super _UNK_ Me , and it 's a little like that but with more focus on farming and the evil _UNK_ company .
Have you seen @205756 on Netflix ? That was a crazy series
So good . I love a good documentary , how about a political one ? @204850 was very intense .
No problem , I think you 'll have to check out @127588 . Enjoy ! Have a great day .

films . I think one that is often overlooked is @193742 . Some of the dialogue is _UNK_ , but it has a unique concept and great scares .
If you like something that is creepy , there is @176641 . I think the original one is the best !
is more playful , there 's always @117333 . It 's a collection of stories so I 'm sure there would be something in there you would enjoy .
theater because it was in the middle of the week when I was off , and _UNK_ out of my skin several times because it was so freaky .
How are you What type of movie are you into ? ?
I can ’ t really recall but _UNK_ like comedy action ? ! @84798 is a good romance I really like @101264

@206029 with _UNK_ _UNK_ . It was a lot like @110605 with Jodie Foster
Suspense . Both are about _UNK_ protecting kids during a home invasion . But nothing gory like @151728

Hi , I 'm great . Thanks for asking . How are you ? What kind of movies do you like ?
loved it . You 'd want to also catch @78340 before seeing part two . Both movies are hilarious and his love interest makes it a little romantic .
I love all the same genres too .
the Comedy category . And its actually a movie based on a Comic _UNK_ series . He 's part of Marvel Universe And it 's packed with comedy .
He 's more of an _UNK_ hero actually so he does n't always do things the right way .
How about @205435 for a good old comedy My favorite all time , would be @143198 Yours ?
Awesome ! I 'm sure you 'll enjoy @78340 he 's played by Ryan Reynolds .
Heh , I 've never seen @202418 but goodfellas is a classic with Ray _UNK_ ! Check that out too . Robert Dinero is in it too .
Enjoy and have a great day Haha , you can thank me now . ; ) Enjoy your viewing .

Hello ! What kind of movies are you into ? I 'm good , I hope you are well , too .

I 'm great .
I do n't think I have ever seen that one . What is the genre like ?
Now that is one that I have seen . Have you ever seen the movie @117159 ?
It is definitely a good one for female coming of age story and it has a magic element .
There is a movie called @163586 that would fall along these lines though these girls take a path that is n't necessarily the right one .
I hope that helps you . thank you and good bye

I hope you enjoy your movie ! Good bye !
Hello ! How are you ? I 'm doing well . What kind of movie are you looking for ?
No , I do n't think I 've seen that one .
If you like that type of movie , you might like @147538 .
Actually , @147538 is a comedy based on a true crime case . Kinda crazy .
How about @166729 ? That 's a funny comedy with a _UNK_ kind of love interest . I have to look up @88267 . It sounds interesting .
Cool . I will look at that . @174394 is a crazy kind of love story as well . I hope I have helped you out ?

Otherwise too @156698 might be something along those lines as well . Oh that is a good movie too .
Well I hope I helped some .
Awesome . Good bye .

Yes , I love horror movies . I enjoy the old ones . How about something like @99244 ? Always a _UNK_ .
movies like @193742 . The dialogue is a bit _UNK_ , but the concept and scares are great . Freddy Krueger is the man of horror for sure !
Do you like old ones like @148114 ?

Hi . Great . Do you like Westerns ?
I just saw @93115 and it was awesome .

And Jeff Bridges in @83814
YW . Hope you find something you like .
@188057 was a great movie , did you see the _UNK_ ?
@196668 and @181546 are my favorites

I 'm doing good . What kind of movie are you looking for ? I can make general suggestions if you like , too .
Okay . How about @191911 ? I saw that and enjoyed it . Do n't watch it if you are scared of heights , though .
Yes , it is .
I like seeing the other side of issues , so I would actually like to see @90768 @95019 sounds interesting .
There was that movie about the guy who played Big Bird ...
@119227 is good , too . You have a great day ! Goodbye !
Hi Seen any good movies lately ? @204704 was good . Very suspenseful .
It 's on my list . @136369 was amazing . And @98699 I met the guy who wrote the novel .
_UNK_ . Did you see him in @140651
Mine too . It was nice chatting with you . Have a good day
Hey
@181299 Or maybe @139492 . Nicholas Cage is in that , so it 's kind of campy sometimes .
And @78480 makes me cry everytime Nicholas Cage was in @171914 too . But I would n't call it campy
Hi
Have you seen @175843 ?
Also @171245 is also great to see as well .
Another movie he might like is @176558

That 's a good one ! have a few ideas .

I thought it was great !
I do n't think he was a kid in that one . @135485 is an awesome movie ! Have you seen @148231 ?
Another movie you might like is @169750 . It was also directed by Steven Spielberg
You should rewatch all the @101158 movies before the new one !
You 're welcome !
Have a great day !
What kind of movies do you like ?
like old terror movies , you might like @83586 . There is also a really funny movie that I saw at the _UNK_ of my _UNK_ called @194556 .
Everybody seemed to love @205430 . I have n't seen it yet but plan to .
The previews look good for @205353 . I have a friend who said she loved it .
the trailer for it . It 's a fresh take on the slasher genre . I hope I 've helped you out with a few of these suggestions ?
I looked : @110419 It was surprisingly good ! It had a neat twist . I hope you have a great day ! Goodbye . Enjoy your movies !
those are great movies
may i suggest @121366
you like tom hanks movies soo i can suggest @78172 and @145338 those are dramas too
same too you
If you like mysteries , maybe @112719 would be a good one . Have you seen that ?
I recommend @111488 or @158571
Yes , it 's a more modern take on a noir mystery film . I think you will like it . Does that suggestion sound good ?
Thank you , goodbye !
well , that is not the movie i was suggesting
Game night 2018
it was great , check out @114341
I want to see @149829
not a regular Batman fan though
I think it is , with slight adult references like they all seem to have
oh , I am a huge fan @135571 and all of the sequels
Both , many many times but @135571 is my absolute favorite
Take care
One of my favorites is @184605 . Have you seen it ?
It 's a bit older . @192815 is more recent and good . Have you seen that ?

Thank you too , _UNK_ a great night and goodbye .

You 'll love the second one too , I think !
Of course ! Have a great night- goodbye !
Good and yourself ?
really got into them . I always enjoyed reading my stephen king books and then watching those movies . There are a number of great ones like @109453 .
Oh yes my father picked that one up .
@194336 oh haha well that explains it I think that it 's crazy he changed the ending for the movie because of all the death _UNK_ he received .
Awesome . Well you have a great night . good bye .
Hello , what kind of movies do you like ?
Do you like the @204292 movies especially ?
Oh so you like the movies that have a possibility of being real ? What about movies like @197213
I have n't seen the whole thing , but it involves _UNK_ . I heard it was a very good movie . What about movies like @132885 ?
That is a good movie , have you seen all three ? @168039
I enjoyed them too . It was nice talking with you !
A romantic comedy then ?

I 've never seen @86619 You too ! Good night .

Oh , that 's a great category .
I could suggest @107350 with Johnny Depp . It 's a musical , but it has lots of gore .
You could also see @184418 .
Oh , yes , the clown movie was great . Haha !
I had to remind myself . You would like @183184 . It is very scary and has a monster that stalks some kids , if I remember correctly .

Me too ! Did you watch @204974 ?
Oh man . I have n't seen it yet but I want to ,
I agree . It was nice chatting movies with you . Have a good day !
Dang that movie is so funny . One of the funniest movies ever made .
about 45 minutes of it before I decided to turn it off because I did not find it funny . We have different type of humor I guess .
Ah . It depends , I just do n't like Jack Black so him being in the movie is not a good thing
Yea . He is pretty good in it from what i remember . Tom Cruise was the best part I will probably finish that movie _UNK_ .
No I have not actaully . i Have seen all the @188057 movie series Really excited for the next one coming out in a month
5th one are so good . One of my most favorite action movies I have ever seen in a theater . Have you seen @205430 by any chance ?
but I have been told my multiple people that its worth seeing in theater so I am probably going tomorrow . Have you by any chance seen @178927 ?
No problem . Thanks to you too .
. it is hard to remember I did like Infinity War , It is probably my favorite of this year along with @205430 Have you seen it yet ?
Yea . It is really good , you should check it out while it still in theater . It wont be the same in your house .
Have you seen @204870 by any chance this year ?
Yea . I loved it too although I personally thought the first one was better .
Yea not at all . I personally liked the first one better but the second was really good .
Thats fine . I can ask you about a movie . I see a lot in my free time . Yes , I loved that movie .
It is probably my favorite movie by pixar of this decade _UNK_ Inside Out .
Yea the previews did not appeal to me either but I was shocked by the movie . Thank You .
Hello ! What is your favorite movie of 2018 so far ?
Yes , i have seen that movie . It is good . Have you by any chance seen @155467 ?
It is about a serial Killer and it has Robert Downey Jr and it is directed by David Fincher You will love it
my head about fantasy serial killers . But have you seen @180224 Its a horror movie about a killer and they have to find out who is the killer
Yea that movie Zodiac is based on the Zodiac Killer

Oh yes I want to see that one so bad . I ca n't wait .
@111776 was so funny . Have you seen all their movies ? @78510 ?
It is not as well known as the rest .
They 're in a restaurant setting .
So , yeah all that fun and _UNK_ that can come with it .
But since I 'm still thinking of my all time favorite childhood movie @203619 .
My mother says I wanted to watch it multiple times a day

Yes , I can watch that one a million times . I know it _UNK_ - might be sad to admit lol
Thanks , you too . Bye for now .
Any type of movies you 're in the mood for ?
Hmm , lets see ... A good start would be @204331 and then maybe @205435 After that I 'd say , @84273 or @189592
Also @98088 and @165438 were hilarious too . Nice , me too !
And of course why not end it with any of the @122552 @136087 movies

Oh , interesting Let me think a moment on that .
Oh wow , I actually was about to say that one lol but you beat me to it . I loved that movie .
I 'm not sure I know of many horror musicals but I 'd be able to recommend some horror films ...
I hear @125431 was okay Oh wow , how did I forget that one ? ! Yes , that 's another classic !
I 'd say @171615 while it 's not quite horror I love the musical parts of it .
Hah , nice !
LOL . Right ! One of my favorites ! Love Tim Burton movies !
Oh wow never saw that .
how about @148245 that was n't really horror though . lol
You 're welcome . Bye for now .
I ca n't wait until it comes out , either ! How about @171718 ? My son and I went to see it with his friend this morning .
Love @122604 . Great animation , great music .
@171718 was playing as a $ 1 movie at _UNK_ , a summer thing .
If you ca n't remember it , look it up . It 's a fun movie .
they do in the summer for the kids 2 times a week . You had great suggestions with @154844 and @162647 . I hope I helped a little ?
I hope you have a nice day ! Goodbye !
I 'm good , I hope you are as well ?
Those are great films ! How about @80067 ?
It never really gets old .
Are you into some of the Japanese films like @154920 ? We love that one . So imaginative .

Well , I hope you enjoy watching some of these animated films !
Good bye
Good afternoon ! I 'm good , I hope you are as well . What kind of movies are you looking for ?

@91327 is about a _UNK_ who takes off to Hollywood and tries to make it big in the movies . Like , old Hollywood . It 's fun .

@106132 is a popular one !
Yes , he is typical Bill Murray . How about @189705 ? That 's another Murray classic .
@200089 was a bit different .
@178331 is one I have n't seen yet . I am putting it on my list !
Thanks for the recommendation !
@139839 is on my list to see . How about @107826 ?
It kept me laughing . You have to be in the right mood though or it 's just cheesy .
Have you seen @111063 ?
What about @108945 ? That 's kind of on the same tip as @106588
Was that the sequel to @178885 ?
I think you might also like @152883 It has Gary Oldman and some other great cast members _UNK_ drama
What about @178096 ?
That was funny
Oh , gosh , yes . Have you seen @190543 ? I loved Bill Murray in that
Me too ! Thanks for the _UNK_ !
If you are in the mood for a comedy ? @142895 had me rolling on the floor Sci Fi , I loved @155969
Oh , you should There 's another one about Mars @206079 you might want to check out
Yes , I saw @197213 . It was brainy .
@101264 was good as well . In @206079 a life form is found under the surface on Mars that _UNK_ Earth
How about @81475 ? _UNK_ that ?
In the mood for some Sci-Fi ? Have you seen @77521
Just that it 's Sci-Fi . I loved Blade Runner as well ! How about @165416 that was GREAT !

You might enjoy it ! Did you like @193213 ? Along the same lines as Blade Runner .
I agree . Well , I 'm off to do some movie _UNK_ now
@120092 was awesome ! Have you seen any of Guillermo del Toro 's other stuff , like @117515 ?
liked them both . If you like horror but want something a little different , you should check out @144263 if you have n't seen it It 's great
. @144263 is set in a dance school in Germany that is also a witch 's _UNK_ . It 's very _UNK_ 70s horror with a great soundtrack .

Hello !
Sure ! Did you see @150941 ?
Sure . You should also check out @97153
Musicals or something else ?
I have n't seen that yet . @92441 is a great escape movie , too ! Check it out if you have n't
Yes ! Along with @171914 . Those two are like a guilty pleasure double feature .
And Steve Buscemi . He 's great in everything .
Have you seen @188293 ?
Buscemi wrote and directed that I really liked it
And of course he stars in it Nice talking to you as well !
Oh , that 's a movie I have n't seen . If you like Drama , I really enjoyed @172660 recently .
was fab ! I also really enjoyed @111540 - I have n't watched the original yet , but it is on my list . Have you seen @111540 ?
Do you enjoy war movies ?
the classics .. I can recommend @193710 and @178557 for a Sunday afternoon marathon . I 've not seen @205054 - I will have to check it out .
Jodie Foster ? I do n't think I 've seen it ...
Is it similar to @110605 ?
Yes me too ! Nice to talk with you : )
Ah ! Okay .. let 's see ....
There are the classics , like @202190 and @170119
@202190 is the early 80s ... which I guess is the past now ... _UNK_ , I feel old lol I have not seen @131178
It 's not a ghost story , but it is a good horror flick set in the past ... @125540 is about Dr. _UNK_ 's maid .
It is ! very different . It has Julia Roberts and John _UNK_ .
@125540 has a ton of costumes . _UNK_ and _UNK_ everywhere @121148 is very well done . Set in the _UNK_ era , very well directed and photographed .
@94963 is cheesy but fun , and it is heavy on the costumes and scenery .
Gary Oldman has some pretty fabulous looks going on in that one for sure .
Me too ! Have you seen @111540 ? I have n't seen the original yet though .
've not seen that one . I 'll check it out . I can recommend some old school movies too ... have you seen @193710 ? Or @151198 ?
Yes that one looks interesting . I also like things like @107554
stomach for that one ! Well , we both now have some other movies we can add to our _UNK_ watch ' list ! Nice chatting to you !
There was that movie @138451
Not seen @138042 but I 'll try it How about @111782 ?
@138451 was about a homeless man who was a _UNK_
That one I have n't seen yet or that one . Time to go watch some movies !
How about @141210
You might like @93839
A football coach befriends a mentally challenged young man in @93839
Sort of . You ever seen @122138

How about @177276 ?
There was @110685 that was pretty good
I do n't recall him in @101479 Mr. _UNK_ was a basketball coach Time to go watch a movie . Bye
Awesome . What kind of movies do you like ?
Have you seen @205435 ?
a middle-aged couple start their own casino in their house . Super funny
Actually I got that confused with @188779 that is already on video you should check that one out for sure !
yes !
never seen it
sounds awesome Alright . I hope you liked the suggestions . Have an awesome day . Goodbye !
Doing great ! What kind of movies do you like ?
I love a good drama . Have you seen @91882 or @120092 ?
completely honest But it does have really good reviews . Seems to have many religious undertones . So i 'm guessing you would need to be into that .
how about @79968 ?
Its about a guy who has 23 split personalities and one of them remains _UNK_ in his subconscious . Very good movie !
Yes It received good reviews too !
Awesome . Hope you like it ! Have a great day . Goodbye !
Have you seen @89429 ? It 's a great book and even better movie !
Yes .
Yes . The same
Of course , there 's @77455 ...
and @82321 You 're welcome !
oh thats one of my favorite movies , 80 's forever !
have you sen the sixth sense ? thats one of my faves . it was filmed in my old neighborhood
i dont think I 've ever heard of @102703 whats it about ?
oh that sounds too sad for me .... my favorite movie is @133251 have you seen it ?
its a comedy - tom hanks is the star and its hilarious - highly recommended !
i havent seen @142895 ill have to check it out
i watched @152127 last night and it was sooo funny
i love @119662 that my moms favorite ever
_UNK_ up !
Have no seen the classics of the genre , like @161313 ? That should be & quot ; have you seen ... & quot ;
How about @102116 , the original with Patrick Swayze ?
also featuring Keanu !
If you are willing to watching something older , @93383 is very good , better than the reboot , @121726 .
the original has four stars on IMDB ! happy watching !
Like @162873 ? Hmmm . Have you seen @77542 ? It 's sci-fi , but it 's not too dark
Or you could always go with a classic , like @182781
@191297 was great !
Have you seen @194044 ? It 's crazy
I 'm trying to think of a good comparison . It has time travel but it also has hit men . And it has a ton of action
Great ! Enjoy !
Have you seen @152496 ?
Another great dark comedy is @174148 .
You might also like @135084 , the 2004 version . The older ones are n't as funny .

I have n't seen that one but I love @126916
One of my favorites is @203424 I love anthony hopkins
My favorite genre is horror , do you have any suggestions for me ?
I saw that , I thought it was an excellent use of silence in a horror film , especially for a first time director
Yes , _UNK_ is important Have you seen any good comedies lately ?
@204870 was hilarious , I would definitely recommend it
One of my favorites overall is @184605 . I also really enjoy mel brooks movies like @168892
they are definitely worth your time
Doing fine , and you ?
documentary that just _UNK_ away _UNK_ and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its _UNK_ . What do you tend to like in films ?
also have running gags throughout , some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a _UNK_ you 'd almost forget )
Any other films you like in particular ?
just recommend the _UNK_ @195979 , a fun and _UNK_ action film packed with wit , a heist film where almost everything is in _UNK_ with the music .
I 'm not sure , but I can check not at this point , unfortunately
have to stop there . I hope that at least some of these are appealing and that you find at least one enjoyable . Have a good evening .
Me too ! I am a big fan of @161313
It 's a classic
That is also a solid choice ! The best of the terminator films
Do you watch any international action films ?
have you seen @115675 I love both of those ! !
It used to be on netflix
@186421 is also excellent No I 'll look into that for sure
The ending really got me
Yeah I was just waiting for him to die , he lived longer than I thought he would
@182709 is one of my favorites
Oh I did watch the original , not the american remake I have really enjoyed this conversation , I 'm glad we got matched up

Hello my friend . How are you today ?

lol i see . How about @79935 ? Have you watched it ? I think he might be pretty uncomfortable There is also 2 more parts @192020 and @176326
I actually liked @79935 . I watched @192020 with my husband and he was uncomfortable .
I agree with you @79935 is defiantly not worth watching again
making me more uncomfortable , not my husband @79935 is basically a movie for girls . He did n't like it and he said it was dumb . lol
I saw @152847 . I liked it . I have n't seen @106588 . Did you like it ? Is it worth watching ?
to watch together . Bit I don ; t know why . I loved @112719 @112719 is exactly about the revenge ! Maybe you should go with this one
Yes by I ca n't say it 's uncomfortable . Not to me I Guess ) There is for sure a lot of mystery in @112719
I hope you 'll enjoy ! Have a good day !
Me too !
Have you seen @97683 ? It 's an older one , but it 's really great Christopher Walken stars in it

Of course , my all-time favorite super hero movie is @108195 . Ca n't beat the original . I love Christopher Reeves .
If you want to see something with a comedic _UNK_ , you could find @194891 . It was funny .

So I 'm not sure if I would want to see the second one , but I loved @122604 !
@91547 ! That one 's good , too .
Excellent , thank you !
That was n't a horror film , aside from all the singing LOL However how about @176394
Oh ... I thought was that animated musical . Forgive me , have n't seen or heard of it .
LOL , yes ! I figured you were being funny as it was such painful singing . How about @204794 there 's a new one now @187028
Or what 's that one I remember people saying was scary @171056

@169419
Neither do I usually , but this film has some humor to it .
are a majority of the movie , but it has nice graphics . Do you like _UNK_ ? I would rate this movie an 8 out of 10 .
@111918 is a seriously hilarious . it is extremely funny !
_UNK_ really _UNK_ each other . I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie . I do n't think you will regret watching it all the way through .
Yes , otherwise I would be wasting your time .
@142910 is also worth checking out . That is actually the movie with Mark .
you check them out . @124142 is good for Christmas time , but it is a bit corny . The new @83552 is way better than I thought .
Jack Black and the Rock play the roles of the _UNK_ in the game .
There is a new one that came out last year . It is much more funny than the original .
@141928 was alright . @133813 is another classic he is in .
I just do n't like the Nascar theme much .
That sounds great enjoy it with friends .
You also !

Another good comedy is @114669
No , it 's a movie about the history of _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Another good Indie one is @93005
You are welcome . : )
@204794 and @187028 have to be one of my favorites . There 's something super scary about clowns .
Also , @135508 I 've never seen it , but I heard it was good .
actress was actually pushed too hard by the producer and ended up _UNK_ a lot of her true feelings on set . They kept all of the footage .

Hey . Do you like Eddie Murphy ?
Cause I recommend @191672 for the _UNK_ . And @158433 for the family .
I have n't seen that .
If you 're in the mood for a _UNK_ of Bill Murray I suggest @204334 for @120948 .
They probably have few similarities , but you can try .
Remember @120948 is Bill Murray . Why did n't you like @200089 ?
Movies referring to _UNK_ usually are . I do n't know why .
Peace to you !

It 's about a little girl who gets adopted by a family of four . When she comes the family 's life turns _UNK_ down .
_UNK_ slasher films ? Perhaps you might like the old @130591 movies or maybe @86414 . That 's all I can think of right now that are similar .
